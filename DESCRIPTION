Description: The 'pleiosim' package provides tools for simulating pleiotropic genetic data,
    including the generation of genotypes, simulation of heritable and non-heritable phenotypes,
    and calculation of summary statistics. It allows for flexible customization of genetic
    architecture, including effect allele frequencies, effect size matrices, heritability,
    and correlation structures between traits. The package supports modeling pleiotropy,
    cross-trait heterogeneity, within-trait heterogeneity, and simulating diverse cohort
    compositions. It is designed to facilitate research on the genetic architecture of complex traits, pleiotropy, and multi-trait genetic analysis.
